# HackerNews-WebScraper

This project is a python web scraper that uses the Beautiful Soup 4 library to scrape the first two pages of Hacker News for stories with over 100 upvotes on the site, and returns those stories with their titles, article links, and current number of votes in descending order based on upvote total.
